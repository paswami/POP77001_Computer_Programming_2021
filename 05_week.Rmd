# 5 Testing and Debugging in Python

In this week we will focus on how to test and debug a Python program. We will start with the usage of print() statement to analyse the state of function calls and loops. Afterwards, we will talk about more structured ways of error-catching and debugging using exceptions and built-in Python debugger.

## Readings
