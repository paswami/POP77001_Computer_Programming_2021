    "[Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between two points gives the length of a line segment between them (as the crow flies distance). It is a very versatile metric, which can be frequently encountered in statistical applications (e.g. matching) and text analysis (e.g. document similarity). Below is a snippet of code that implements it for two dimensions. How can its modularity be improved? Change the code to provide a more general solution. Extend it to 3 and further (N) dimensions.  "
