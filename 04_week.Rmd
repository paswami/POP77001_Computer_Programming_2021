This week we will discuss functions, one of main building blocks of a program implemented in any language. We will start by looking at unnamed (lambda) functions and proceed to defining functions in Python. Special attention will be given to argument specification and unpacking.

## Readings

- Guttag. Chapter 4

## Lab

- Working with functions in Python

## Assignment 2

- Control flow and functions in Python
- Due at 11:00 on Monday, 11th October (submission on Blackboard)
- Rename the file from `02_assignment.ipynb` to `02_assignment_studentnumber_firstname_lastname.ipynb` before submission
